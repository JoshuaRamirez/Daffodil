# 🟩 **Domain-Driven UI — Feature Domain Reference**

---

## 📘 Purpose

The Feature domain is the **semantic fulfillment engine** of a domain-driven UI system.

It owns the lifecycle, coherence, and correctness of all **domain state**, representing **why system elements exist**, **when they change**, and **what their semantic meaning is** — but it does **not model UI structure, layout, or visibility**.

It is **invoked exclusively** by **interpreted, intention-bearing commands** routed from the Interaction domain.

It **emits two kinds of events**:
- **Update Events** — domain-to-domain, carry data, used by Presentation for internal state updates.
- **Signals** — domain-to-UI via Facade, no data, declare readiness for the UI to query.

---

## 🧐 Identity and Role

The Feature domain:

- Governs domain truth and validity.
- Responds to interpreted behavior, not raw gestures.
- Coordinates Operational domain work (execution, progress, cancellation).
- Emits **Update Events** internally (e.g., `RowProgressUpdated`, `InstructionUpdated`).
- Causes Facade to emit **Signals** externally (e.g., `RowReady`, `BatchCompleted`) to UI clients.
- **Does not model** rendering, UI structure, or projection surfaces.

Feature domain is **not**:

- A gesture interpreter.
- A UI controller.
- A projection engine.
- A binding surface.

It is where **intention becomes fulfillment**, and where system state **becomes semantically valid**.

## 🧱 Domain Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **State Authority** | Owns all lifecycle-relevant semantic state for task, session, or batch execution. |
| **Operational Orchestration** | Invokes asynchronous, mechanical, or concurrent processes via Operational domain components. |
| **Internal Update Emission** | Emits **Update Events** to the Presentation domain after semantic progression. |
| **UI Signal Authorization** | Triggers Facade to emit **Signals** to UI after semantic stability is guaranteed. |
| **Result Interpretation** | Interprets outputs or progress from Operational components into semantic advancement. |

---

## 🗭 Invocation Preconditions

The Feature domain must only be invoked by **Interaction domain** classes.

Feature methods:

- Do **not validate** gesture context.
- Do **not determine** UX flows or screen transitions.
- **Only progress** semantic state based on already-interpreted intent.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Domains

| Domain | Direction | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Interaction** | Receives commands from | Interaction defines the semantic gesture vocabularies and UX flow boundaries. |
| **Operational** | Invokes directly | Operational components are task executors, running mechanical background work. |
| **Presentation** | Publishes **Update Events** via FeatureEvents instance | Presentation subscribes to these Update Events to mutate internal binding state. |
| **Facade** | Causes **Signals** to be emitted to UI | Facade surfaces instance-based Signals after semantic readiness stabilization. |

---

## 🤁 Event Emission Philosophy

The Feature domain **emits two distinct types of events**:

| Event Type | Purpose | Carried Data | Receiver |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Update Event** | Reflect domain state updates to Presentation. | ✅ May carry identifiers, progress percentages, output values, etc. | Presentation Domain (internal) |
| **Signal** | Declare readiness to the UI client to query bindings. | ❌ No data — only readiness notice. | UI Client (via Facade) |

### Update Events:
- Emitted via **FeatureEvents** instance (e.g., `RowProgressUpdated`, `InstructionUpdated`).
- Consumed by Presentation only, internally.

### Signals:
- Triggered at Facade level based on state readiness.
- Surface instance events like `RowReady(string rowId)`, `BatchCompleted()`.

---

## 🧮 Query Surface: Binding-Ready State Access

The UI client **may only query** Presentation Bindings **after receiving a Signal** from the Facade.

✅ Feature **does not expose** direct data access methods to the UI.

✅ Presentation updates its Binding surface by listening to **Update Events**.

✅ UI queries Presentation **after** Signal receipt, not before.

✅ Traversal always begins from **Facade-exposed root Binding triads**.

## ✨ Summary Ruleset

| Rule ID | Rule |
|:---|:---|
| F1 | Feature domain is the sole authority on semantic domain progression. |
| F2 | Feature responds only to semantically interpreted commands, not raw gestures. |
| F3 | Feature emits **Update Events** internally to update Presentation structures. |
| F4 | Feature triggers Facade to emit **Signals** externally to authorize UI rebinding. |
| F5 | Feature must not expose semantic state directly to UI clients. |
| F6 | Feature must not interpret or drive UI rendering directly. |
| F7 | Signals carry **only identifiers or minimal readiness keys**. |
| F8 | Update Events may carry domain data (e.g., progress, artifacts) for internal consumption only. |
| F9 | Full separation: Updates drive Presentation reflection; Signals drive UI rebind permission. |
