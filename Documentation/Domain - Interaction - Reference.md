**Author**: Joshua Ramirez  
**Document**: Interaction Domain Reference  
**Context**: Four-Domain + Facade Model

---

## 📘 Purpose

The **Interaction domain** models the **transition from user gesture to domain meaning**.

It is a **stateless**, **semantically expressive**, and **structurally organized** set of UX intent handlers.  
Its job is not to do the work — but to **understand** what the user wants and **delegate responsibly** to other domains.

---

## 🧠 Role of Interaction

The Interaction domain:

- Defines **intent vocabularies** grouped by UX region
    
- Accepts gesture calls from the Facade
    
- Routes to:
    
    - **Feature domain** — for semantic fulfillment (e.g., execution, state mutation)
        
    - **Presentation domain** — for structural/local UI intent (e.g., opening a modal)
        
- Owns **no state**
    
- Emits **no events**
    
- Exposes **no bindings**
    

It is a **semantic gateway**, not a domain authority.

---

## 🔁 Dual Channel Delegation Model

All gestures flow through Interaction — but may follow two paths:

|Channel|Description|Destination|
|---|---|---|
|**Semantic Flow**|Gesture has domain consequence or state effect|Routed to **Feature**|
|**Structural Flow**|Gesture affects UI-local structural state|Routed to **Presentation (Behaviors)**|

Only the **Interaction domain** may choose which path to follow.

The **UI may not** call Presentation directly.  
The **Feature may not** call Presentation at all.

---

## 📚 Gesture–Action–Binding Triangle

Interaction governs the traversal:

1. **Gesture** → received from UI via Facade
    
2. **Action** → dispatched to Feature or Presentation
    
3. **Binding** → exposed by Presentation for UI rehydration
    

Interaction interprets flat gestures and transforms them into meaningful **semantic flows** or **structural commands**.

---

## 🧱 Composable Behaviors

Interaction may invoke **Behavior interfaces** on Presentation triads — including their **composed children**.

Behavior trees are:

- Exposed via `IComponent.Behaviors`
    
- Navigable via named properties or keyed dictionaries
    
- Fully testable and discoverable
    

```csharp
_batchScreen.Behaviors.Rows[rowId].ToggleInsight();
```

This enables **modular gesture routing** and full UI state orchestration without violating domain purity.

---

## 🗺️ Interaction Regions

Each `Interaction` class represents a **UX region** — a bounded task space or semantic phase.

Examples:

- `PromptDraftInteraction`
    
- `EntryListInteraction`
    
- `BatchControlInteraction`
    

Each region:

- Owns a vocabulary of related gestures
    
- Knows which domain(s) fulfill the intent
    
- Enables flow testing and gesture scoping
    

> 🧭 Interaction regions are the **semantic affordance layer** of the UI.

---

## 🔂 Gesture Resolution Flow

1. UI emits flat gesture
    
2. Facade calls Interaction method
    
3. Interaction interprets intent
    
4. Delegates:
    
    - To Feature (for semantic effects)
        
    - To Presentation (for structural effects)
        
5. Feature may emit projection event
    
6. UI receives event → queries Presentation → rebinds
    

---

## 🔗 Delegation Rules

|Target|When Used|
|---|---|
|**Feature**|Mutation, execution, domain logic|
|**Presentation**|Modal open, toggle state, UX-local transitions|
|**Operational**|Task execution, concurrency, external calls|

Interaction never:

- Holds state
    
- Emits events
    
- Computes readiness
    

---

## ✅ Composition and Usage

Each Interaction class:

- Is constructed in the composition root
    
- Receives dependencies via constructor (e.g., triads or aggregates)
    
- Exposes semantic methods
    

```csharp
public class OutputInteraction
{
    private readonly IBatchScreenBehaviors _screen;

    public OutputInteraction(IBatchScreenBehaviors screen)
    {
        _screen = screen;
    }

    public void ToggleInsight(string rowId)
    {
        _screen.Rows[rowId].ToggleInsight();
    }
}
```


---

## 🔐 Structural Rules

|Rule ID|Rule|
|---|---|
|I1|Interaction regions model UX tasks or phases|
|I2|Interaction owns no state|
|I3|All gesture methods must be semantically valid|
|I4|Interaction never emits projection events|
|I5|Interaction is only invoked via Facade|
|I6|Interaction routes gestures to Presentation or Feature|
|I7|Interaction is the **exclusive site** for dual-channel routing decisions|
|I8|Interaction may traverse behavior trees for deep control|

---

## 🧪 Testing Utility

Interaction regions are ideal for:

- Gesture-level behavior testing
    
- UX flow simulation
    
- Intent→effect validation (without needing UI frameworks)
    

They can be fully tested in isolation using mocks and assertions.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Interaction is where behavior becomes intent.  
> It has no authority — only **insight**.

It interprets, routes, and declares meaning.  
It protects the integrity of UX flows, ensures all gesture logic is scoped, and upholds the architectural contract between **input and intent**.

## 📎 Related Concepts

- **Triadic Components** — Behaviors are exposed for Interaction domain routing
    
- **Dual Channel Delegation** — Structural vs. semantic routing happens here
    
- **Deferred Flow Resolution** — Projection only happens after Interaction → Feature → event
    
- **Domain Facade** — Owns and routes to all Interaction regions
