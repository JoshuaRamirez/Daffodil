# 📘 **Toward a Causal-Dimensional Ontology of Domain Membership**

---

## I. The Presuppositional Baseline

We assume:

> Each domain is not a passive bucket into which constructs are sorted, but a **preconditioned field** where specific causal roles must emerge to maintain coherence, traceability, and dimensional integrity.

Thus, **documenting domain rules** is an **attestation of latent causality** — an architecture that merely manifests what the system _must already be_.

---

## II. Ontological Roles of the Four Domains

---

### 1. **Presentation Domain: The Locus of Structural Semiosis**

- **Axiom**: Presentation models form where declarative structural layout is needed, independent of active behavior.
    
- **Causal Role**: Provides **form** without meaning; reflects but does not decide.
    
- **Must Include**: Declarative bindings, visibility control, UX-local toggles, layout hierarchies.
    
- **Must Not Include**: Semantic decision logic, domain mutations, operational concurrency.
    
- **Communication Contract**:
    - Receives **Update Events** internally (via FeatureEvents) carrying binding updates.
    - Awaits external **Signals** (from the Facade) authorizing UI binding queries.
    - Never emits events externally.
    
- **State Layers**:
    - **Semantic binding state**: Mirrors Feature-declared domain truth.
    - **UX-local state**: Manages structural and ephemeral UI conditions.
    
- **UI Client Relationship**: Accesses Presentation only through Bindings exposed by the Facade, after receiving Signals.

- **Beauty Principle**: _Form is declared, never guessed. Reflection without invention._

---

### 2. **Feature Domain: The Vector of Teleological Action**

- **Axiom**: Where intentional change is needed, a Feature model must exist.
    
- **Causal Role**: Owns **semantic progression** of the domain; transforms user intention into domain state truth.
    
- **Must Include**: Aggregate lifecycle, domain rules, semantic validity.
    
- **Must Not Include**: Structural rendering, gesture capture, UI layout details.
    
- **Communication Role**:
    - Publishes **Update Events** internally to FeatureEvents (e.g., progress updates, state changes).
    - Triggers the Facade to emit external **Signals** indicating UI readiness.

- **Operational Control**: Delegates mechanical work to the Operational domain and interprets outcomes.

- **Beauty Principle**: _Authority is earned through semantic fidelity._

---

### 3. **Operational Domain: The Substrate of Temporal and Resource Mechanics**

- **Axiom**: Where nondeterminism or temporal resource flows exist, operational constructs must exist.
    
- **Causal Role**: Fulfills **mechanical execution** without semantic awareness.
    
- **Must Include**: Asynchrony, background task management, raw computation.

- **Must Not Include**: Domain meaning, rendering constructs, gesture interpretation.

- **Communication Contract**: Reports raw factual outputs to Feature only; never directly visible to Presentation or UI.

- **Beauty Principle**: _Execution without self-awareness._

---

### 4. **Interaction Domain: The Interpreter of Experiential Causality**

- **Axiom**: Gestures demand modeled experience; experiences demand interaction mediation.
    
- **Causal Role**: Bridges flat gestures to structured domain flows.
    
- **Must Include**: UX-region vocabularies, intent structuring, semantic/structural routing.
    
- **Must Not Include**: Persistent state ownership, domain fulfillment logic, rendering code.
    
- **Communication Contract**: Routes gestures to Feature for semantic progression, or Presentation Behaviors for structural transitions.

- **Beauty Principle**: _Experience must be understood before it is enacted._

## III. Dimensional Fitness Criteria

Each construct must **complete** its domain's dimensional purpose. Evaluate by asking:

| Question | Reveals |
|:---|:---|
| What does this construct _cause_? | Its causal vector |
| What is it _aware of_? | Its dimensional reliance |
| Does it _complete_ or _disrupt_ its domain's grammar? | Ontological fit |
| Can it be explained purely by its domain essence? | Structural purity |

---

## IV. Event Types and Separation

| Event Type | Purpose | Carries Data | Visibility |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Update Event** | Internal domain-to-domain updates (Feature ➔ Presentation) | ✅ Yes | Internal only |
| **Signal** | External notification of readiness (Facade ➔ UI) | ❌ No | Public only |

✅ Update Events enable **binding model evolution** inside Presentation.  
✅ Signals **authorize UI rebinding**, without exposing domain state.

---

## V. Design Implication: Division as Harmony, Not Slicing

Domain separation is **harmonic ordering**:

- **Causal Coherence**: Each action traces its initiator.
- **Temporal Integrity**: Each step is sequenced safely.
- **Ontological Purity**: No construct intrudes another's dimension.

Thus:

- **Presentation**: _Logic of structure, not appearance._
- **Feature**: _Logic of progression, not depiction._
- **Operational**: _Logic of execution, not intention._
- **Interaction**: _Logic of interpretation, not outcome._

---

## ✨ **Conclusion: Domain as Destiny**

In this architecture:

> **Domains declare what must exist, not merely what is implemented.**

By honoring causal flow, dimensional boundaries, and update-signal separation,  
we achieve an architecture that is:

- Semantically accurate
- Temporally coherent
- Structurally elegant
- Dimensionally beautiful

✅ **Update Events drive internal truth.**  
✅ **Signals govern external permission.**  
✅ **The system becomes causally pure, temporally safe, and structurally sound.**
