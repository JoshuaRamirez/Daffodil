## 🔒 Purpose

This document codifies **non-negotiable architectural rules** that govern domain flow, event separation, binding integrity, and signal discipline.  
These invariants ensure:

- Safe domain evolution
- Traceable causal correctness
- Temporal safety for UI rendering
- Clear separation of Update Events and Signals

They are testable, traceable, and binding.

## 🔹 1. Command Contracts

|ID|Rule|
|---|---|
|R1|All UI → domain gesture commands must return `void` or `Task` only|
|R2|No command may return DTOs, state objects, or domain state outputs|
|R3|All domain state must be exposed via queryable `Bindings` surfaces only|
|R4|All gesture routing occurs via Interaction — never UI directly into Feature or Presentation|

## 📅 2. Event Flow and Signal Separation

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R5  | Domain-to-domain communication uses **Update Events**, which may carry data (e.g., identifiers, progress percentages).         |
| R6  | UI-facing communication uses **Signals**, which carry **only readiness notifications** — never domain state or data.           |
| R7  | Signals are emitted only by the Facade after semantic or structural readiness is declared.                                      |
| R8  | Signals must be emitted via **instance fields** on the Facade — no static/global buses permitted.                               |
| R9  | No Signal may embed domain or presentation state — UI must query Bindings after Signal reception.                              |
| R10 | Presentation components subscribe privately to Update Events to mutate their internal UX state based on Feature domain output. |
| R11 | UI may query Bindings only **after** a Signal is received from the Facade.                                                      |

## 📊 3. Event and Signal Discipline

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R12 | Feature domain emits **Update Events** internally to FeatureEvents for Presentation to observe.                |
| R13 | Presentation domain subscribes internally to **Update Events** and mutates only its private state.             |
| R14 | Only the Facade emits UI-facing **Signals**.                                                                    |
| R15 | UI clients must never subscribe directly to Update Events or Feature domain events — only Facade Signals.       |
| R16 | No event, Update or Signal, may expose mutable Binding surfaces directly.                                       |
| R17 | Update Events enable Presentation mutations; Signals enable UI rendering permission.                           |

## 🔁 4. Declarative Binding Requirements

| ID  | Rule                                                                                   |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R18 | All Presentation state must be queryable via `Bindings` surfaces only                  |
| R19 | All visual effects must derive solely from `Bindings` or UI-local state                |
| R20 | UI must not render speculatively — only after a Signal allows Binding queries          |
| R21 | UI transitions (hover, animations, etc.) must derive only from Bindings or UI-internal state |
| R22 | All `Bindings` interfaces must expose child Bindings compositionally                   |
| R23 | Binding access follows triadic structural traversal, not dynamic method query patterns |

## ⛓ 5. Access & Mutation Boundaries

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R24 | UI may not mutate domain state directly                                                                                 |
| R25 | Only Interaction may issue commands to Feature or Presentation Behaviors                                                |
| R26 | Presentation may mutate its own internal UX-local state via private Update Event handlers or Behavior calls             |
| R27 | Feature domain may never call, reference, or mutate Presentation components directly                                    |
| R28 | Operational domain may only be invoked by Feature domain — no cross-domain leakage                                      |
| R29 | Once a Signal is emitted from the Facade, the UI is permitted to query Bindings — not before.                           |
| R30 | Only the Interaction domain may determine if a gesture routes semantically (Feature) or structurally (Presentation)     |
| R31 | Operational → Feature communication must use delegates or local observer patterns — no static buses.                    |

---

## ⚛️ 6. Temporal Integrity

|ID|Rule|
|---|---|
|R32|All UI renderable state is gated behind explicit Signals emitted by the Facade|
|R33|UI rendering may only be triggered after a declared Signal emission — not direct state mutation|
|R34|Signals carry only readiness notifications, never progress percentages or other domain data|
|R35|Binding traversal must always follow: `Signal received → Binding queried → UI rebinds`|
|R36|Presentation components mutate internal UX state in response to Update Events, not external commands|

---

## 🧩 7. Domain Structure & Composition

| ID  | Rule                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R37 | Every domain must expose a `[DomainName]Domain.Create()` method for explicit construction                           |
| R38 | Domain Facades must expose all gesture methods and root Bindings/Behaviors for UI access                            |
| R39 | Internal FeatureEvents bus instance exists per domain for Update Event publication — no static buses allowed        |
| R40 | All triadic components (Bindings, Behaviors, Components) must be explicitly composed inside the domain Factory      |
| R41 | Dependency injection is optional — explicit manual wiring is preferred                                              |
| R42 | Triads must expose `Bindings` and `Behaviors` via typed properties and structural child compositions                 |
| R43 | Presentation component trees must be declaratively composed — no dynamic runtime composition or discovery           |
| R44 | Update Events are allowed only inside domain boundaries; Signals are allowed only from Facade outward to UI          |
| R45 | Presentation must separate private Update Event handlers from public Behaviors cleanly                               |

## 🎓 Closing Principle

> **The distinction between Updates and Signals is causal law.**

- Updates coordinate internal domain evolution and structural mutation.
- Signals authorize UI rehydration safely after domain stability is assured.
- Presentation reacts privately to internal Updates.
- UI renders only passively after public Signals.

✅ Domain-driven architecture remains causally pure.  
✅ Binding traversal remains temporally safe.  
✅ The system remains extensible, scalable, and fully dimensionally sound.
