summary: Defines how UI gestures are issued, routed, and rebind permissions are granted via signal notifications, ensuring full causal flow while domain internal updates remain correctly separated.

**Author**: Joshua Ramirez  
**Document**: Domain-Driven - UI I/O Reference  
**Context**: Gesture-to-Update-to-Signal Architectural Pathways

---

## 📘 Introduction

This document defines the **legal interaction pathways** between the UI and a domain-driven system. It covers how:

- UI gestures become structured domain intent
- Feature domains publish **Update Events** to internal domain subscribers (like Presentation)
- Facade emits **Signals** externally to UI to authorize safe binding
- UI rebinds only after receiving a **Signal**, never speculatively

This flow supports a **causally correct**, **testable**, and **temporally aligned UI architecture**.

---

## 🗭 System Structure

The system consists of:

- **Flat gestures from the UI**
- **Deferred routing and domain resolution**
- **Internal Update Event publication for domain coherence**
- **UI-facing Signal emission for binding authorization**
- **Structural binding traversal for rendering**

Each layer fulfills a strict causal role in the **Gesture → Update → Signal → Binding** lifecycle.

---

## 🧬 Input Model: Flat Gesture Emission

UI emits intent as flat method calls on the **Domain Facade**:

```csharp
facade.AddEntryRow();
facade.ToggleInsight("row_42");
````

- UI has no knowledge of domain structure
    
- No DI, no flow knowledge, no state assumption
    
- Every command returns `void` or `Task`
    

---

## 🔁 Internal Domain Event Model: Update Events

Within the domain, **Feature components** publish **Update Events** through the **FeatureEvents bus**.

- Presentation subscribes to **Update Events** privately.
    
- Update Events **may carry data** necessary for internal mutation (e.g., progress percent, new output text).
    
- Update Events never leave the domain boundary.
    

Example Update Event subscription inside Presentation:

```csharp
_featureEvents.SubscribeRowProgressUpdated(OnRowProgressUpdated);
```

✅ Enables structural, causally safe mutation internally without UI visibility.

---

## 📡 Output Model: Signal Emission to UI

The **Domain Facade** emits **Signals** to UI clients:

- Signals **only declare readiness** (e.g., `RowCompleted`, `GlobalProgressUpdated`).
    
- Signals **carry only minimal identifiers** (e.g., `rowId`) — no state.
    
- UI listens to Signals and **queries triadic Bindings** thereafter.
    

Example Signal usage:

```csharp
facade.RowCompleted += rowId =>
{
    var row = facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId];
    RenderRow(row);
};
```

✅ UI stays passive, declarative, and non-speculative.

---

## 🌲 Binding Access via Composable Trees

The UI queries a **single root triadic binding** exposed by the Facade:

```csharp
var screen = facade.Bindings;
var row = screen.Rows["row_42"];
RenderRow(row);
```

No query methods are allowed:

- ❌ `GetRowBindings(id)`
    
- ✅ `facade.Bindings.Rows[id]`
    

Binding composition ensures:

- Declarative traversal
    
- Structural clarity
    
- Causal binding safety
    

---

## 🔏 Behavioral Separation by Domain

|Layer|Role|
|---|---|
|**UI**|Emits gestures, listens to Signals, traverses Bindings|
|**Facade**|Routes gestures to Interaction, emits Signals|
|**Interaction**|Interprets intent, chooses semantic (Feature) or structural (Presentation) path|
|**Feature**|Publishes Update Events internally, coordinates semantic progression|
|**Presentation**|Subscribes to Update Events privately, updates internal state, exposes declarative Bindings|

---

## 🧫 Full Gesture-Update-Signal-Binding Lifecycle

```plaintext
1. UI → Facade: AddEntryRow()
2. Facade → EntryListInteraction
3. Interaction → Feature: AddRow()
4. Feature → publishes UpdateEvent (RowAdded)
5. Presentation → subscribes, mutates internal state
6. Facade → emits Signal (RowCompleted)
7. UI subscribes to Signal
8. UI queries: facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId]
9. UI rebinds and renders
```

✅ Clean temporal sequencing  
✅ Causal event chaining  
✅ Full separation of concerns

---

## 🧪 Testing Behavior

- You can trigger gestures via facade methods.
    
- Subscribe to Signals emitted by the Facade.
    
- Assert that Presentation triads reflect the expected updated state.
    
- No need for mocks — just subscription observation and binding traversal.
    

✅ Full lifecycle validation without UI frameworks.

---

## ✅ Architectural Commitments

|Commitment|Enforcement|
|---|---|
|Gesture routing only via Facade|✅|
|Binding access only via triadic trees|✅|
|Update Events may carry data internally|✅|
|Signals to UI may carry only IDs (no state)|✅|
|UI binds only after receiving a Signal|✅|
|Presentation never emits Signals itself|✅|

---

## ❌ Illegal Patterns (Updated)

```csharp
// ❌ Do not query Presentation state before receiving a Signal
var row = facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId];

// ❌ Do not allow Presentation to emit public Signals
_presentation.EmitSignal(); // ❌

// ❌ Do not route UI gestures directly to Feature without Interaction
feature.AddRow(); // ❌
```

---

## ✅ Legal Patterns (Updated)

```csharp
// Emit Gesture
facade.AddEntryRow();

// Presentation internally reacts via FeatureEvents
_featureEvents.SubscribeRowAdded(OnRowAdded);

// UI binds only after Signal received
facade.RowCompleted += rowId => {
    var row = facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId];
    RenderRow(row);
};
```

## ✨ Closing Principle

> Causal integrity demands that internal domain updates and external UI signals be kept distinct.  
> Updates convey structural truth across domains.  
> Signals grant permission for passive binding.

The Domain-Driven UI I/O model is **safe**, **declarative**, **semantically traceable**, and **causally isolated across system layers**.
