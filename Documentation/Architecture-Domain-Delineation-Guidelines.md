## 📘 Introduction

This document defines the **boundaries, responsibilities, communication patterns, and event flows** between the four core domains in a causal-dimensional UI system.

Each domain operates in a **structurally isolated**, **functionally specific**, and **causally ordered** way.

The system now formally separates:

- **Update Events**: Domain-to-domain notifications. May **carry data**.
- **Signals**: Domain-to-UI notifications via the Facade. **Carry no data**, only readiness.

---

## 🔴 Interaction Domain — _Comprehension and Gesture Structuring_

### **Purpose**

The Interaction domain models **user-driven intention** and reconstructs **UX flow semantics** from flat gestures routed through the Facade.  
It organizes gestures into **task-oriented regions** and routes meaningfully to Feature, Operational, or Presentation domains.

### **Responsibilities**

- Receive UI gesture calls (via the Facade)
- Group behavior into UX-region interaction objects
- Delegate meaningfully to Feature or Presentation (structural/semantic split)
- Define the **gesture vocabulary per UX task**

### **Constraints**

- Cannot own state
- Cannot emit Update Events or Signals
- Routes exclusively via domain surface methods
- Remains **semantically coherent and testable**

---

## 🟩 Feature Domain — _Semantic Fulfillment_

### **Purpose**

The Feature domain is the **executor of comprehended intent**.  
It owns the semantic truth of the system, orchestrates operational work, and signals state readiness internally and externally.

### **Responsibilities**

- Own domain lifecycle and semantic state
- Initiate Operational tasks
- Emit **Update Events** internally via FeatureEvents (to Presentation)
- Cause **Signals** externally via Facade (to UI)

### **Constraints**

- Cannot interpret UI gestures
- Cannot mutate Presentation directly
- Emits only Update Events internally; cannot emit Signals directly
- UI cannot query Feature directly — only via Presentation Bindings

---

## 🟨 Operational Domain — _Mechanical Execution_

### **Purpose**

The Operational domain performs **mechanical, concurrent, or asynchronous work** without semantic knowledge.  
It executes tasks initiated by Feature and reports back raw results.

### **Responsibilities**

- Perform mechanical work (I/O, computation, task management)
- Emit mechanical results and errors
- Remain stateless and domain-agnostic

### **Constraints**

- Cannot emit Signals or Update Events
- Must remain fully testable, framework-agnostic

---

## 🗭 Presentation Domain — _Declarative Structural Surface_

### **Purpose**

The Presentation domain models **renderable UI structure**, passively reflecting Feature state after internal Update Events or UI behaviors.

### **Responsibilities**

- Subscribe internally to **Update Events** from FeatureEvents (e.g., progress, output readiness)
- Update private UX-local state upon Update reception
- Expose **Bindings** (readonly) for UI queries
- Expose **Behaviors** (for UI structural changes like toggles)

### **Constraints**

- Cannot emit Signals or Update Events
- Cannot mutate Feature domain state
- Public surface must only expose Bindings and Behaviors
- Subscribes to Update Events privately; only Facade signals externally to UI

---

## 📉 Domain Facade — _Gesture Router and UI Signal Surface_

### **Purpose**

The Domain Facade is the **exclusive UI-facing entry and exit point**.

It:

- Receives gestures (void/Task methods only)
- Routes gestures to Interaction regions
- Emits **Signals** to UI when domain state is ready for query
- Exposes root Binding trees for UI traversal

### **Constraints**

- Cannot mutate domain state itself
- Cannot interpret gestures (only forward)
- Emits **only Signals** externally
- Must expose Bindings/Behaviors structurally

## 📡 Communication Patterns and Directionality

|From → To|Mechanism|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|UI → Facade|Method call|Flat gesture emission|
|Facade → Interaction|Forward|Gesture routing only|
|Interaction → Feature|Delegation|Meaningful domain delegation|
|Feature → FeatureEvents|UpdateEvent publish|Internal semantic update signaling|
|FeatureEvents → Presentation|Subscription|Presentation updates private state|
|Feature → Facade|Trigger Signal|Upon readiness declaration|
|Facade → UI|Signal|UI rebinds after readiness signal|
|UI → Facade → Presentation|Behavior call|Structural UX-local transitions|

## 📢 Event Flow Separation (Update Events vs Signals)

|Type|Emitted By|Consumed By|Carries Data?|Purpose|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Update Event|Feature (via FeatureEvents)|Presentation|✅|Internal structure and state updates|
|Signal|Facade|UI client|❌|Readiness notification only for UI rebinding|

---

## 🧠 Signals vs Updates Recap

|Concept|Signals|Update Events|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Emission Target|UI|Internal (Presentation)|
|Carrying State?|❌ No (Signal only)|✅ Yes (Update carries data)|
|Trigger Binding Update?|✅ After Signal UI rebinds|✅ Private Presentation mutation|
|Emitted By|Facade|Feature via FeatureEvents|

---

## ✨ Design Principles Summary

|Domain|Statement|
|---|---|
|**Interaction**|Gesture → interpreted intent (no state, no events)|
|**Feature**|Meaning → fulfillment (Update Events emitted internally, Signals triggered externally)|
|**Operational**|Task fulfillment (execution engine only)|
|**Presentation**|Reflection → passive exposure of Binding state (private Update Event subscriptions)|
|**Facade**|Surface → Signal emission to UI and structural traversal for Bindings/Behaviors|
