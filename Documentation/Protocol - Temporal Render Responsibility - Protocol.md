summary: Describes how mutation and rendering are separated temporally to ensure rendering only reflects fully coherent domain states, using internal Update Events and external UI Signals.
architectureModel: Domain-Driven UI - Causal-Dimensional Model
architecturePhilosophy: Causality, update-driven mutation, signal-driven readiness, and declarative rendering separate architectural concerns cleanly.
context: Eliminates premature UI updates by binding rendering responsibility strictly to domain readiness, separating internal Update Events from UI Signals.
intendedUse: Delay UI rebindings until semantic state stabilization is guaranteed by domain-driven Signals.

# 📘 Introduction

In traditional reactive architectures, the moment a state mutation occurs is implicitly coupled to UI rendering.  
This fusion — where mutation _is_ reactivity — leads to fragile race conditions, unclear ownership, and speculative rendering.

> **This architecture eliminates that fusion entirely.**
>
> **Mutation is separated from render authorization.**

✅ Mutation happens through **Update Events** internally.  
✅ Render permission happens only through explicit **Signals** externally.

# 🧭 Core Principle: Temporal Readiness Contract

In this architecture:

- **Feature domain emits Update Events internally** (e.g., to Presentation).
- **Feature domain causes Facade to emit external Signals**.
- **UI may only render after receiving a Signal**.

|Layer|Responsibility|
|:--|:--|
|**Feature Domain**|Interprets correctness; emits internal Update Events; causes UI Signals.|
|**Presentation Domain**|Subscribes to Update Events; holds binding state.|
|**Facade**|Emits UI Signals after readiness stabilization.|
|**UI Client**|Listens to Signals; queries Bindings after Signal.|
|**Operational Domain**|Optional mechanical execution; invisible to UI.|

# 📚 Updated System Flow

```plaintext
1. UI emits gesture to Facade.
2. Facade routes gesture to Interaction.
3. Interaction delegates to Feature (or Presentation Behavior).
4. Feature executes and emits Update Events internally.
5. Presentation mutates internal binding state.
6. Facade emits a Signal after domain readiness.
7. UI listens to the Signal.
8. UI queries the Bindings tree.
9. UI rebinds declaratively.
````

✅ Update Events **carry internal mutation data**.  
✅ Signals **carry no data** — only **readiness notification**.

---

# 🔥 Why This Separation Matters

- ✅ **Prevents premature rendering.**
    
- ✅ **Preserves binding surface purity.**
    
- ✅ **Separates semantic meaning (Feature) from structural reflection (Presentation).**
    
- ✅ **Creates passive, event-driven UI rendering discipline.**
    

---

# 📡 Signal Definition

- Signals are **instance events** on the **Facade**.
    
- Signals **never carry domain state** (no DTOs, no snapshots).
    
- Signals only notify that Presentation Bindings are ready for safe querying.
    

✅ UI must **wait** for a Signal before traversing Bindings.

---

# 💬 Correct Usage Example

```csharp
// Feature publishes Update Event internally:
_featureEvents.PublishRowCompleted(rowId);

// Presentation updates internal binding model:
_featureEvents.SubscribeRowCompleted(rowId => _rows[rowId].MarkCompleted());

// Facade emits Signal externally:
_featureEvents.SubscribeRowCompleted(rowId => RowCompleted?.Invoke(rowId));

// UI listens to Signal:
facade.RowCompleted += rowId =>
{
    var row = facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId];
    RenderRow(row);
};
```

✅ Update carries state internally.  
✅ Signal carries only permission externally.

---

# 🚫 Anti-Pattern: Data-Push via Signals

```csharp
// ❌ Forbidden:
RowCompleted?.Invoke(new RowBindingModel { Output = "Final result" });

// Why?
// - Coupling Feature to Presentation structure
// - Violates Signal minimalism
// - Breaks binding purity
```

---

# 🧠 Reframed Event Vocabulary

|Event|Meaning|
|:--|:--|
|`RowCompleted(rowId)`|_"Row with rowId is now ready for UI binding."_|
|`ProgressUpdated(rowId)`|_"Row progress has structurally stabilized."_|
|`ScreenReady()`|_"The screen's Binding tree is complete and coherent."_|

✅ Always **Signals** external readiness, not state content.

# 📦 Structural Summary

|Type|Purpose|Carries Data?|Audience|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Update Event**|Internal binding state mutation|✅ Yes|Presentation Domain|
|**Signal**|External UI binding permission|❌ No|UI Client|

---

# ✨ Closing Principle

> **Rendering is not a reflex to mutation.  
> Rendering is a response to explicit, domain-declared readiness.**

✅ Feature owns correctness.  
✅ Presentation holds structure.  
✅ Facade signals readiness.  
✅ UI binds only when allowed.
