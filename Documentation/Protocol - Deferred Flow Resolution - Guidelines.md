**Author**: Joshua Ramirez  
**Context**: Domain-Driven UI Architecture — Gesture Interpretation, Update Emission, Signal Projection  
**Status**: Canonical Theory — Version 1.1: Event Separation Aligned

---

## 🧭 Abstract

**Deferred Flow Resolution** defines how **flat, imperative gestures emitted by the UI** are resolved into **structured, semantically meaningful domain flows** downstream — without the UI modeling flow structure.

Critically, this version introduces **causal separation between internal Update Events** (domain-to-domain communication) and **external Signals** (domain-to-UI permission notifications).

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

UI developers naturally want to issue flat, intent-driven calls like:

```csharp
facade.AddEntryRow();
facade.ToggleInsight("row_42");
````

But domain architects require these gestures to form structured UX workflows like:

- “Entry List Management”
    
- “Prompt Configuration”
    
- “Batch Execution”
    

Moreover, **internal semantic updates** must be separated from **UI readiness signaling**, ensuring safe, causal rendering without state leakage.

**Deferred Flow Resolution** solves this tension by structurally dividing gesture routing, domain updates, and UI signaling.

## 🎯 Protocol: Deferred Flow Resolution

|Layer|Role|
|:--|:--|
|**UI**|Emits flat gestures via the Facade|
|**Facade**|Routes gestures to Interaction regions|
|**Interaction**|Interprets gestures into domain semantic or structural meaning|
|**Feature**|Executes semantic actions; publishes internal **Update Events** via FeatureEvents|
|**Presentation**|Subscribes to Update Events; mutates internal renderable state|
|**Facade (again)**|Emits outward **Signals** to UI clients after readiness is stabilized|
|**UI (again)**|Listens to Facade Signals → Queries Bindings → Renders declaratively|

✅ UI stays simple.  
✅ Domain structure and event separation preserved.  
✅ Causal safety and temporal correctness guaranteed.

## 🔁 Updated Flow Example

```plaintext
UI Clicks "Add Entry"
   ↓
DomainFacade.AddEntryRow()
   ↓
[ Deferred Interpretation ]
   ↓
EntryListInteraction.AddEntryRow()
   ↓
EntryListFeature.AddRow()
   ↓
EntryListFeature publishes RowAdded Update Event (internal)
   ↓
EntryListPresentation listens, updates internal RowBindings
   ↓
Facade emits RowAdded Signal (external)
   ↓
UI receives Signal, queries facade.Bindings.Rows[rowId], renders
```

✅ Gesture is interpreted into semantic meaning.  
✅ Update Events drive internal domain binding updates.  
✅ Signals govern external permission to rebind.

---

## 🧠 Role of the Facade

The Facade:

- Accepts flat gesture methods (fire-and-forget)
    
- Routes to correct Interaction regions
    
- Does **not** interpret gestures
    
- Emits **Signals** outward only after Feature or Presentation declare readiness
    
- Exposes **root triadic Bindings and Behaviors**
    

✅ Stateless membrane between UI and domain internal structure.  
✅ No data exposed via gestures or signals — only readiness notification.

---

## 🧠 Role of Interaction

Interaction:

- Interprets gestures into domain actions (semantic or structural)
    
- Routes to Feature for semantic commands
    
- Routes to Presentation Behaviors for structural UI transitions
    
- Emits no events itself
    

✅ Stateless intent router.  
✅ Dual-channel delegator (semantic and structural).

---

## 🧠 Role of Feature

Feature:

- Executes domain semantic actions
    
- Publishes **Update Events** via FeatureEvents bus
    
- Does not directly mutate Presentation
    

✅ Sole semantic authority inside the domain.

---

## 🧠 Role of Presentation

Presentation:

- Subscribes to FeatureEvents Update Events internally
    
- Mutates private UX-structure and renderable state
    
- Never emits outward events
    
- Exposes passive, readonly Bindings for UI rehydration
    

✅ Passive reflector of semantic updates.  
✅ Internal state machine for structural UX local flows.

---

## 🧠 Role of the UI

UI:

- Emits flat gestures into the Facade
    
- Listens only to outward **Signals**
    
- Queries Bindings tree after Signal receipt
    
- Binds declaratively with no speculative reads
    

✅ Structurally passive.  
✅ Safe, causally ordered projection lifecycle.

---

## 🧱 Architectural Event Model Summary

|Type|Purpose|May Carry Data?|Visibility|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Update Events**|Feature ➔ Presentation updates|✅ Yes (IDs, updated values)|Internal Only|
|**Signals**|Facade ➔ UI readiness|❌ No (IDs only)|External Only|

✅ Full update/signal separation enforced.

## 📚 Narrative Analogy

UI: "I want to start something."  
Facade: "Gesture accepted — delegating interpretation."  
Interaction: "This belongs to 'Entry List' management."  
Feature: "Adding an entry. Publishing RowAdded update."  
Presentation: "Got RowAdded update — binding updated."  
Facade: "Ready now. Emitting RowAdded signal."  
UI: "Got the signal. Now I'll bind and render."

## 🔻 Layer Responsibilities Recap

|Layer|Input|Output|Notes|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**UI**|Emit gestures|Listen for Signals|Queries Bindings after|
|**Facade**|Route gestures|Emit Signals|Exposes Bindings/Behaviors|
|**Interaction**|Interpret gestures|Delegate commands|Stateless|
|**Feature**|Execute semantic operations|Publish Update Events|No direct UI involvement|
|**Presentation**|Subscribe to Update Events|Update private state|Exposes Bindings passively|

## ✨ Closing Principle

> **Deferred Flow Resolution is the bridge from flat gestures to structured, causally clean domain action and declarative UI reflection.**

It ensures gestures are semantically interpreted, updates are causally ordered, and signals allow binding only when stability is assured.

✅ Gesture is interpreted.  
✅ Update is reflected internally.  
✅ Signal is emitted externally.  
✅ Rendering is passive, safe, and dimensionally pure.
