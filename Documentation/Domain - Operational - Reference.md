summary: Defines the Operational domain as the engine of time-based, resource-driven behaviors, causally isolated from semantic meaning and presentation structure.
architectureModel: Domain-Driven UI - Causal-Dimensional Model
architecturePhilosophy: Causality, semantic projection, and declarative rendering separate architectural concerns cleanly.

**Author**: Joshua Ramirez  
**Document**: Operational Domain Reference â€” Version 1.1  
**Context**: Domain-Driven UI Architecture â€” Four-Domain + Facade Model

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

The Operational domain defines **mechanical, asynchronous execution units** within a domain-driven UI system.

It handles **time-based** or **resource-driven behaviors** such as:

- File I/O
- Background computation
- External system interactions
- Simulation loops

without embedding semantic meaning, presentation structure, or projection responsibility.

It **produces only raw outputs**, which the **Feature domain interprets** into meaningful state changes.

---

## ðŸ›  Domain Role and Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Execute time-based or mechanical tasks** | Perform actions that are asynchronous or involve external systems |
| **Expose Task-returning APIs** | Provide `Task`-based methods to allow natural async control |
| **Emit mechanical-only outputs** | Progress updates, completion reports, or error signals |
| **Remain unaware of semantic meaning** | Never embed interpretation, rendering, or UI impact |

---

## ðŸ“¡ Scope and Access Model

| Scope Rule | Enforcement |
|:--|:--|
| Accessed only by Feature domain | âœ… |
| No direct observation by Presentation, Interaction, or Facade | âœ… |
| Reports only raw operational results | âœ… |
| Offers mechanical Task control surfaces | âœ… |
| Emits raw Update Events (internal to Feature) if applicable | âœ… |

---

## ðŸ“¦ Characteristics

| Trait | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Statelessness | No internal domain state |
| Temporal Execution | Supports delayed, asynchronous operations |
| Result Emission | Emits progress, completion, or error updates |
| Controlled Lifecycle | Created, owned, and destroyed by Feature aggregates |
| Testability | Can be unit-tested in isolation |

---

## ðŸ§¬ Usage Pattern

Feature domain example:

```csharp
var executor = new SimulatedWorkExecutor();
executor.ProgressReported += OnProgressUpdate;
executor.OutputProduced += OnFinalOutput;

await executor.StartAsync(rowId); // Exposes Task
````

âœ… **Progress and final outputs are reported via event delegates.**  
âœ… **Meaning is assigned only by Feature â€” not by Operational units.**

---

## ðŸ§± Lifecycle Rules

- Constructed on-demand by Feature aggregates
    
- Disposed or terminated when operation completes or is canceled
    
- No shared mutable state across tasks unless explicitly coordinated
    
- Always wrapped inside Feature-controlled task flows
    

---

## ðŸ”— Relationship to Other Domains

|Domain|Interaction Type|Note|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Feature**|Full ownership and invocation|Sole interpreter of Operational outputs|
|**Presentation**|None|Cannot observe or mutate|
|**Interaction**|None|Cannot invoke directly|
|**Facade**|None|Never signals UI directly|

---

## ðŸš€ Event Emission and Async Control

Operational components **may emit**:

- **Progress updates** (e.g., `"Row 5 is 40% complete"`)
    
- **Final raw outputs** (e.g., `"Execution complete for Row 7"`)
    
- **Error conditions** (e.g., `"Timeout error at Row 3"`)
    

But they **must not**:

- Emit semantic events
    
- Reference Presentation or Binding models
    
- Initiate UI Signals
    

âœ… Outputs are internal **Update Events** consumable by the Feature domain only.

---

## ðŸ›  Structural Examples

Typical Operational units include:

- `SimulatedWorkExecutor`
    
- `BatchRowExecutionTask`
    
- `FileUploadProcessor`
    
- `ConcurrentBatchRunner`
    

Each must:

- Expose `Task StartAsync(...)` or similar
    
- Offer event hooks for progress/completion
    
- Provide optional interrupt/cancel APIs
    

---

## ðŸ“‹ Updated Summary Ruleset

|ID|Rule|
|:--|:--|
|O1|Operational domain is Feature-private|
|O2|Operational emits raw Update Events or async Task results|
|O3|Operational never interacts with Presentation domain|
|O4|Operational components must remain stateless or Feature-owned|
|O5|Feature fully interprets all Operational outputs|
|O6|No UI rendering, signaling, or projection logic allowed|
|O7|Operational components are instantiable and independently testable|
|O8|Operational methods should expose `Task` or `Task<T>` where appropriate|

---

## ðŸ§  Closing Principle

> **The Operational domain is not a creator of meaning â€” it is an executor of tasks.**

Its actions are **purely mechanical**.  
Its outputs are **purely factual**.  
Its existence is justified **only through Feature domain interpretation**.

âœ… **No semantic leakage.**  
âœ… **No UI dependency.**  
âœ… **Full isolation for clean causality.**
